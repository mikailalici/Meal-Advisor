# Meal-Advisor


Project Description :  Have you or anyone around you suffered from not knowing what to cook for the day? 

Have you ever faced the problem of lacking a recipe to prepare for your visitors or family?

Meal Advisor is a project app designed to solve the problems of everyone who need assistance in their kitchen. In only a few steps, you can easily decide on what to cook, and even learn and get assistance on how to do it!   

The purpose of this projectis to help everyone that have troubles with cooking. I thought of this after hearing Moms saying: “What will I cook today?” And this usually becomes a problem especially when one does not have a wide range of ingredients at home, resulting them to be unable to cook many of the dishes. As a result of it all, we came up with the Meal Advisor app.
