3. Summary

We discusses about some errors in Meal Advisor part two or need some changes in app design layout.
We also added end user layout to part two. Creating main logo and later added more options to make 
it as start up screen page that enables users to navigates through each section and can select any
option to get ready to use recipes. We are planning to have our first testing session next week for
Meal advisor app whether by using Android Studio or other Android based testing application.
